# PassGenerator
## Overview
That's a cross-platform password generator that was written in Python. There are some options, for example, you can change length of generated passwords, change used combinations of symbols, disable/enable some symbol's registers, also you can generate password, which consists only from digits, special symbols or lowercase/uppercase letters.
## Why I've written that?
I've written that password generator for these reasons:
+ I wanted to improve my Python skills and explore new libraries.
+ I was interested in another project's developing, and so I needed to explore libraries that I will be having to use in the future.
## Why I've posted this on GitHub?
I've written that password generator in the beginning of 2020, but then I didn't have a GitHub account and for this reason I couldn't post my works there.
## Will I improve or rewrite that project?
In the near future, I don't plan to improve that project, rewrite with GUI or using another programming language, but I can't deny that I will do it in future.
## How to install all dependencies and use it?
For installing dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For launching password generator:
```
python main.py
```
